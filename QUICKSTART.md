# ⚡ Quick Start - Stellar Strider MVP

## 🎯 What You Have Now

✅ **Smart Contract** (Rust/Soroban)
- Location: `contract/src/lib.rs`
- Compiled WASM: `contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm`
- Functions: `submit_time()` and `get_record()`

✅ **Frontend App** (React)
- Location: `frontend/src/`
- Dev server running at: `http://localhost:5173`
- Features: GPS tracking, loop validation, wallet connection

## 🚀 Test It Right Now (5 Minutes)

### 1. View the App

The dev server should be running. If not:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Sahil Gupta\Desktop\web3\stellar-strider\frontend"
npm run dev
```

Open: **http://localhost:5173**

### 2. Test GPS Tracking (Without Blockchain)

1. Click **"Start Run"**
2. Allow location access
3. Walk around (or simulate in browser DevTools):
   - Press F12
   - Click "..." menu → More tools → Sensors
   - Select a location or create custom GPS coordinates
4. Click **"Stop Run"**
5. See your stats: time, distance, loop validation

### 3. Test Wallet Connection

1. Install Freighter Wallet:
   - Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore (search "Freighter")
   - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org
2. Create/import wallet
3. In app, click **"Connect Wallet"**
4. Approve in Freighter popup

## 📱 Demo Without Walking

### Simulate GPS in Chrome DevTools

1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. **Click Menu (⋮)** → More Tools → **Sensors**
3. **Under Location**, select "Custom location"
4. **Enter coordinates**:
   - Latitude: `28.6139` (Delhi)
   - Longitude: `77.2090`
5. Click **"Start Run"** in app
6. **Change coordinates slightly**:
   - Latitude: `28.6145`
   - Longitude: `77.2095`
7. Wait a few seconds
8. **Return to start**:
   - Latitude: `28.6139`
   - Longitude: `77.2090`
9. Click **"Stop Run"**
10. Should show **"Valid loop!"**

- Show live path drawing
- Show timer running
- Return to start point

**[1:30-1:50]** Validate loop
- Click "Stop Run"
- Show "Valid loop!" message
- Show final time and distance

**[1:50-2:10]** Submit to blockchain
- Click "Submit to Blockchain"
- Show success message
- Explain: "In production, this would be recorded on Stellar"

**[2:10-2:30]** Show the code
- Quick view of smart contract
- Highlight `submit_time` function
- Show it's built with Rust and Soroban

## 🎯 Hackathon Presentation Tips

### Key Points to Emphasize:

1. **Real Innovation**
   - First GPS + Blockchain racing app on Stellar
   - Solves trust problem in racing (no cheating!)

2. **Technical Achievements**
   - Rust smart contract (Soroban)

```

## 📝 Next Steps to Production

### Priority 1 (Must Have):
- [ ] Deploy contract to Futurenet
- [ ] Connect frontend to deployed contract
- [ ] Test end-to-end blockchain submission

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have):
- [ ] Add leaderboard display
- [ ] Improve UI/UX
- [ ] Add more validation
- [ ] Error handling

### Priority 3 (Future):
- [ ] NFT minting for champions
- [ ] Prize pool system
- [ ] Social features
- [ ] Mobile app

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App not loading?
```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Contract won't compile?
```powershell
cd contract
cargo clean
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### GPS not working?
- Must use HTTPS or localhost
- Allow location permissions
- Use Chrome DevTools to simulate
